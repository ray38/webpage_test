## Introduction

“SPARC-X is a project to develop a density functional theory (DFT) code to conduct Quantum simulations at extreme scale and achieve ab-initio reactive dynamics from first principles. The project will leverage the SPARC finite-difference DFT engine in conjunction with new developments in numerical methods, machine learning, and high-performance computing to produce a software suite capable of operating on emerging exascale machines to perform DFT and molecular dynamics calculations at unprecedented levels of theory for massive numbers of atoms (~10^6) and long timescales (~1 ns). The project combines diverse expertise from the fields of solid-state physics, numerical methods, high-performance computing, catalysis, machine learning, and visualization, and is supported by the DOE Computational Chemical Sciences program (Grant No. ####).”
